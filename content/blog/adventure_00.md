Welcome to the detective adventure.

The ice cream scoop has been stolen.  Without it we cannot have ice cream later.  Can you detectives Harper, Hunter and Skye solve the mystery?  You will need to solve the clues.  

The first clue is upstairs in a bedroom.  Whose bedroom?  Maybe this will help.  The last letter of my name comes straight after the first letter of my name in the alphabet.
